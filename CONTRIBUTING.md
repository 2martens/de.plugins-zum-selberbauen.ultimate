CONTRIBUTING
============

First of all: Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Ultimate CMS! However, you have to meet some requirements in order to get your changes accepted.

General requirements
--------------------
- Testing is the key, you MUST try out your changes before submitting pull requests. It saves me and yourself a lot of time.
- The code SHOULD be written by yourself, otherwise you have to check the license beforehand with regard to compatibility and give the proper credit to the original author.

Files
-----
- Unix newlines (\n) MUST be used in every file (php, tpl, less, js, etc.)
- All files MUST be saved in UTF-8 encoding

Formatting
----------
- Tabs MUST be used for indentation, you HAVE TO use a tab size of 4
    - empty lines MUST be indentated as deep as the previous line
    - multi-line database strings MUST contain tabs until the level of indentation of the previous line is achieved, 
    from there on only spaces are to be used
    - because it is very important: Within database strings are no tabs allowed other than those previously mentioned.
- All identifiers and comments MUST be written in English
- PHP
    - The closing PHP tag MUST be omitted
    - Every file MUST end with a newline character (\n)

Additionally: Have a look at existing files to find out what they should look like.
