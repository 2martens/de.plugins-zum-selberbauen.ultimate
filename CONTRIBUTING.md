CONTRIBUTING
============

First of all: Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Ultimate CMS! However, you have to meet some requirements in order to get your changes accepted.

General requirements
--------------------
- Testing is the key, you MUST try out your changes before submitting pull requests. It saves me and yourself a lot of time.
- The code SHOULD be written by yourself, otherwise you have to check the license beforehand with regard to compatibility and give the proper credit to the original author.

Files
-----
- Unix newlines (\n) MUST be used in every file (php, tpl, less, js, etc.)
- All files MUST be saved in UTF-8 encoding

Formatting
----------
- Tabs MUST be used for indentation, you HAVE TO use a tab size of 4
    - empty lines MUST be indentated as deep as the previous line
    - multi-line database strings MUST contain tabs until the level of indentation of the previous line is achieved, 
    from there on only spaces are to be used
    - because it is very important: Within database strings are no tabs allowed other than those previously mentioned.
- All identifiers and comments MUST be written in English
- PHP
    - The closing PHP tag MUST be omitted
    - Every file MUST end with a newline character (\n)

Additionally: Have a look at existing files to find out what they should look like.

I am running [PHP Codesniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) to ensure most of my formatting rules. You SHOULD test your changes before submitting them with it.

1. Install PHP Codesniffer, either via PEAR or via cloning it
2. Execute the following command in the root of your clone of Ultimate CMS:

   ```sh
    $ phpcs -p --extensions=php --standard="`path/to`/CodeSniff/PzS" .
   ```
3. Fix any errors
4. Repeat it until no more errors occur
